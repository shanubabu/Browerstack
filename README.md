Hi Team, 

I am sharing the Selenium Assignment. 

I would request you to Open src/main/jav/Assign.java

just wish to add a note that Transalte Api is working so did tried multiple instance to use them but i guess the issue is with the backend system.{"messages":"The API is unreachable, please contact the API provider", "info": "Your Client (working) ---> Gateway (working) ---> API (not working)"}. Could not work on actually script translation. Apart from that please review the project.
